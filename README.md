# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This was a Scrimba project to create a meme generator app. The app provides fetches meme images from an API, displays them in random so that the user can add suitable captions.
I updated the project to use the Giphy API to fetch gifs instead. Added the ability to select a tv show from the dropdown. 
I hosted it on vercel.[Tv Show Gif enerator](https://tv-show-random-gif-generator.vercel.app/)
